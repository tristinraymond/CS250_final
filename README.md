## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
The best way to interpret user needs and implement them into a program is by first understanding what the needs of the user are. The second step involves breaking down the needs into manageable chunks of work. We can start by looking at the end goal and working our way backwards until we have a solid place to start. As long as functionality is able to happen, then the UI/UX inerfaces can be customized at a later point to make it more visually appealing. 

User stories help with this process as they are a great way to turn the user's needs into details. For instance, creating a user story for the concept of "creating a drop down filter menu" would go into further detail about what the menu might need for optimal function, as well as what type of list or search we would be filtering with a drop down menu. 


## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I personally like approaching programs by looking at the whole picture. Once I can fully understand the program and its goals/needs, I am able to create a stepwise process that turns those goals into a reality. Thinking about the program from the finished project back to the start gives me a great idea of just how much work the program might need, as well as an ideal starting point for the project. This also allows me to focus on the steps that are crucial first, rather than spending time on something abstract before the program has any sort of backbone to work with. 

One Agile practice that I think goes in hand with this ideology is the idea of focusing on value based things, rather than cosmetic. It is okay if the program is not the most flashy looking thing while in development becuase my job is first and foremost to make sure that the program does what it needs to do. Visually appealing elements can be added later to complement the funcitonality of the program. 

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
In my opinion, a good team member is open and honest about their work. Corners are not getting cut and if help is needed, then that is communicated to the team. I also am a big fan of efficiency, so I think that is something a good team member might have in their repertoire. Above all however, I think communication is the number one skill that a team member needs to be a part of a successful team.
